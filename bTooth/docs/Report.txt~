3 Final Design

3.1 Design Architecture
- old design architecture w/o RCU and r_enable added
- fifo added to the desi
3.2
 The rationale for implementing bluetooth as a transmission method is because we can easily have a number of paired devices transmit to a single master adress and the fact that a bluetooth setup can be made more compact than a wifi.
Bluetooth utilizez bluetooth 1.0b. The data packet transmission occurs via an LCAP protol ACL DHL5 packets meaning that  multiple slave devices can connect to a master and  a maximum data packet size of 336 bits is allowe since the data is not 1/3 FEC encoded. The system utilizies a hardcoded bluetooth adress of 00:0A:D9:EB:66:C7 (00000000 : 00001010 : 11011001 : 11101011:01100110:11000111). As such device discovery is not available, the rationale for not implementing this is to add security of the data by restricting the hardware that can acess this data. 

3.3

The total time between a readenable and 256 bits of data being available is 1.104 ms.
